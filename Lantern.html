        <h2>Chapter 1: A humble beginning</h2>

        <p>We all have our own stories to tell, some good some bad, but before all this even begin, before I became “Death the destroyer of worlds” I was only human, and it all began on a farm underneath a tree. 
One day there is a child running around playing with a wooden sword shouting “I am the strongest warrior of all the realms HAAAAA!”, but then he heard someone crying, and so he stops and found a baby on a basket, the basket has symbols written in a Celtic way saying spártha translates “has been spared” the boy did not understand the writing, but he knows one thing, he can’t just leave this baby alone, and so did just that, he took the baby home, his parents were surprised that he took a child home with him, but the boy say his reasons and they gladly agree to take care of that baby as their own, and that baby was me, they were deciding what should they name me and then Leo said “how about Jack?” mother responds on a laughing matter “Jack it is”. 
The years have passed, and I became 10 years old, it was just a normal life, I help my dad on the farm, and help my mother to cook, but my most favorite thing to do, is playing with my brother to the same island of where he found me, and we both dream of becoming warriors heroes of the realm, I was thankful that he came and take me home as his own. 
In many more years to come we stick to that dream of ours and never wanting more but have each other backs and always be there for each other, we are so inseparable back then like I’m his shadow that follows him around. 
There's also the time when I was on a train station waiting for Leo to arrive from his deliveries, and I can’t forget how happy I am just to see him back every single time, we do the same thing repeatedly and we don’t even complain because we love doing it. 
10 years later we started training and sparing, we really took that dream seriously, I never would have thought that we would go that far, but we were dedicated to becoming warriors of the realms. 
One day when we were sparing, we keep a score board of who wins in every match, but every single time he always beats me, but that day I wanted to make a difference, so I go through my limits and actually beat him, I jokingly said “that all you got old man?” We both had a laugh at it, and he replied, “you got lucky Jack it won’t happen again”, and we just walked home and rested when the day was over. 
We keep doing that every single day until one of us either yield or lose, our father thinks we are just hurting ourselves for a dream that might not even be possible, and Leo always disagrees, while our mother is just supportive and always sides with Leo, then they asked me “how about you Jack why do you do this?” and I just replied “well I do this to be strong enough to protect the people around me” they all crack a smile, and we all just continue eating our dinner. 
I told myself every time I train with Leo that I do this so I could be stronger to protect the family that lend me their home, the family the adopted me from that tree, the family that took care of me all those years ago, I could not thank them enough, and this is my way of saying thank you to them, if something would have happened to them I would blame myself for that, because I love them and I would do anything to protect them no matter what, it was a promise I will forever keep for them.</p>
        
        <p>And one day my mother told us that we would have a new sibling, Leo was excited and so was father, while I was there smiling and wondering if it was going to be another brother? Or a sister.</p>
